## Building From Source

To build the application from source, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed:
- Python 3.x
- PyQt5
- cx_Freeze

```bash
pip install PyQt5 cx_Freeze
```

### Build the Executable

Navigate to the project directory and run the build script:

```bash
cd path/to/your/project
python Setup_Build.py build
```

This will create an executable in the `build` directory.

### Creating the Installer

To create an installer, you will need Inno Setup:

1. Download and install Inno Setup from [here](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php).
2. Open your `.iss` script file with Inno Setup Compiler.
3. Compile the script to create the installer.

The `.iss` file should be configured to include files from the `build` directory where the executable is located.
